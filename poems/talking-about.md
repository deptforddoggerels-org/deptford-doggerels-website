So we are talking about rocks,
Then we talked about poverty.
Talking about sins,
what we are doing in this monopoly.
Was searching for the answers and now I’ve found the clarity.
Living the light now is all that can be.
The message is the word to end this hypocrisy.
Human beings have forgotten the ways of humanity.
Zephinahs made me realize my words can show man what to be.
Trapped in my mind I was looking at theology.
I now know my path is the road to bring anarchy.
The world has been asleep now it’s time to let it be free.
Let it be..
Let it be free..
Let it be
Let it be free..
Free Palsetine.
