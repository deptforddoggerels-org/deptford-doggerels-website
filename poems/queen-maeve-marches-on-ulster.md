A tempestuous queen
seen marching obscene 
amounts of men
down the bothirín 

canopied by oak leaves 
and evergreen trees
her warriors take the lead,
she’s nestled in between.

Born of fierce kings,
queenship no questioning
rival lord he bends the knee
Her bride-groom he will be

Sovereignty ne’er lest her sex
Rí Maeve is High Queen
Eriú rivers her veins flooded 
moon-blood majesty

Our land is a woman
And so it's our cunt-
rí.
