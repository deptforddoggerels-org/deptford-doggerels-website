I’ve often found myself 
Circling down the drain 
Round and round 
And back and forth
Spinning and stretching 
Into the The 
Moving uncontrollably 
And getting stuck 
The walls of the The 
Consist of a slippery and sticky stuff That if you look into for too long Will start making sense, 
Then once sense is grasped It will morph 
And change 
Into senselessness 
The The from the top 
When looking down into it, 
Like a child at the lip of a well Looks quite cosy, 
A blanketed descent 
Into a comforting embrace — If not a very long way down 
If you spat down into it 
The spit could travel for a second And splat to the bottom 
In no time at all 
Signalling the way is safe 
And not too far to go
Then upon initiating your climb 
Before you know it 
You’d look back 
And you’ve travelled down miles 
And hours 
Into the The — 
Realising you’ve not left 
A trail of breadcrumbs 
To help you line 
Your clambering path back out 
The The twists and spirals 
In on itself — 
The whole way down 
You’re preoccupied 
By the thoughtless rantings 
Of your heart and mind 
Sometimes you find others 
Down in the The 
Making the enclosed space 
Seem less lonely 
More embracing, 
Than the dreaded lonesome claustrophobia It can often exude 
A hand grasped in the The
Is a hand held onto 
And brought to your cheek 
In a snatch of comfort and warmth For the duration that 
Your mind allows 
Concentration 
To be held on the hand 
You will inevitably 
Eventually 
Find your way 
Out of the The, 
Your time in there will come to an end And you’ll be able to step back And admire your work 
The intricacies of the large T Flowing neatly into ‘h’ and ‘e’ Hours of nothing but the The Nothing much to show for it
And nothing communicable to others 
They don’t know your The 
They’re preoccupied with theirs. In its state of unknownness 
There’s room for assumption Just be weary of leaving the The
The sudden realisation 
Of external reality, 
While often severely harsh, 
Can be the reason that others 
Tell tales of caution 
And warnings against the The 
They’ll say that, 
While you’ve spent so much time Working on your The 
And the The is now 
Tactile and existing — 
You’ve had your head in it for far too long And have forgotten to write 
The rest of your sentence.
