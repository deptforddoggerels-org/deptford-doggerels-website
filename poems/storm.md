Wind batters sails 
They wail in the strain 
Wave after wave 
of infinite black
Crash against the hull
Like lightning cracking stone 
Night does not share her stars 
But I try to remember them still 
Bolts of blinding white
bleed into a midnight purple 
and spread like ivy across the sky 
Their bellows shake the world 
An avalanche of rain 
drowns all sound 
Except for the shouting 
 and for the rage 
But I hear your voice still
And that’s enough for now
I know it’s not your fault 
But you were there 
I know you love me for who I can be
but hate me for bringing you out this far 
 
Lovecraftian shapes swirl below
Tentacles and teeth and gills and scales
Silhouettes of every fear 
close in on every side 
They could have swallowed us days ago 
but wait for us to let it happen 
I am not afraid of Scylla or Charybdis
because it’s easy to blame the sea monsters
It’s hard to get to work 
I am not alive because it is easy 
I am alive because it is difficult 
And should I see summer rest her laurels on your face once more,
I will understand why I am here 
I will always want one more hour
One more day
One more lifetime
For I am not alive for the good 
I am alive in spite of the bad 

Should I last one more lifetime 
Or one more day
Or one more hour 
Then I have beaten you, sea
I cannot swim, my friend
All I can do is float 
I cannot change, my love 
All I can do is try 
Since I could walk
I have stumbled
Since I could talk
I have stuttered
Since I met you
I have become 
I have fallen countlessly 
And yet these scabby knees 
And these cut up palms 
will always stand me back up 
just one more time 
I was born to lose 
And yet here I am 
And here we are 
My hands are wrought 
Ice white and crimson red 
I don’t think holding on gets easier  
I think we just get better at it
Long ago the sun promised she would come again
I will hold you until we see her rise.
